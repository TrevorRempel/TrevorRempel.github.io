{"name":"New York City Through the Eyes of a Taxi","tagline":"An analysis of taxi pickups and dropoffs from 2015","body":"#What is life like in New York City?\r\nOften a question like this is answered by consulting the myriad of available social media data:\r\n* Facebook\r\n* Blog Posts\r\n* Twitter\r\n* Yelp\r\n\r\nHere we will take an alternative perspective and analyze <a href = http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml> data </a> on taxi pickups and dropoffs from 2015. Each data point contains the following information:\r\n\r\n![Panda Frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/TaxiData.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# A Snapshot of New York City\r\nWith a bit of data wrangling we can get an interesting overview of NYC.\r\n\r\n##Plotting Pickups \r\nThe simplest thing to do is just plot each pickup location on a map\r\n>\r\n<img src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/map_of_newyork.png\" width = 800>\r\n\r\nWhite points are the pickup latitude and longitudes, while the black lines are the actual road geographies obtained from a census shapefile. \r\n\r\n## Getting Around\r\nAs each data point has the pickup/dropoff time and trip distance we can calculate the average speed. Grouping by the hour of the day gives an idea of when the busiest times to be on the road are. We have also plotted the total number of pickups during that hour; this should be inversely correlated with average speed. \r\n>\r\n![Getting Around](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/GettingAroundNewYork.png)\r\n\r\nWe can see how this trend plays out on a day to day basis by grouping the data by weekday. As one might expect the average speed is highest, and number of pickups lowest on a Sunday. \r\n>\r\n![Getting Around All](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/GettingAroundNewYorkALL.png)\r\n\r\n##Going to the Airport\r\nIt is particularly important to know travel times when heading to the airport; filtering the average speed data specifically for trips to/from Newark and JFK gives\r\n>\r\n![Airport Speed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/AverageSpeedtoAirport.png)\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising to see that the average speed to/from an airport is much higher than the overall average speed. Also we can see that the worst time of day to make a trip to either airport is between 3pm and 5pm. Again we can group this data by weekday to see how the trend behaves on a day to day basis\r\n>\r\n![Airport Speed All](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/AverageSpeedtoAirportALL.png)\r\n\r\nWe have also plotted the number of trips to and from each airport; giving an indication of how busy the airport will be when a passenger gets there. \r\n>\r\n![Num to Airport](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/NumberofAirportPickups.png)\r\n\r\nIt is immediately obvious that JFK is a much more popular airport than Newark, at least for people living in NYC. Also we see that both airports are likely to be most congested around 3pm. Grouping by weekday again we see, somewhat surprisingly that Sunday is the most popular day to fly.\r\n>\r\n![Num to Airport All](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/NumberofAirportPickupsALL.png)\r\n\r\n##What are Newyorkers Like?\r\nIt is also possible to get an idea of how generous Newyorkers are, how far they are willing to travel for work and entertainment,\r\nand how often they share cabs. \r\n>\r\n![newyorkers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/newyorkers.png)\r\n\r\nOf particular interest is that, on average, Newyorkers are only willing to travel 3 miles, something to consider if you are planning on opening a business. \r\n\r\n#Popularity of Restaurants and Nightlife Venues\r\n\r\nThe taxi data also gives us a way to compare the popularity of a venue, based on its Yelp rating, to the number of people that seem to actually be going there.  \r\n\r\n##Restaurants\r\nUsing the Yelp Api, we obtained the top 40 restaurants in NYC and plotted them on a map, not surprisingly many of are in Manhattan\r\n>\r\n<img src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/RestMap2.png\" height = 600>\r\n\r\nFor each restaurant we obtained its address as a latitude and longitude and then looked at the number of dropoffs within a 15 meter radius of that address. This should give some measure of the popularity of the locale. The figure below has the restaurants ordered from left to right by popularity on Yelp.\r\n>\r\n![rest graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/rest.png)\r\n\r\nWe can visualize this on a map with the size of the circle indicating its relative popularity\r\n>\r\n<img src =\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/RestMapSize2.png\" height = 600>\r\n\r\nSo, if you are looking for a quite restaurant for date night on Friday, pick one of the venues with the smallest number of dropoffs.\r\n\r\n##Nightlife\r\nOn the other hand suppose you want to know the best places to go on a Friday night to meet new people. To answer this question we pulled the top 40 venues categorized as \"Nightlife\" and found\r\n>\r\n<img src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/NightlifeMap2.png\" height = 600>\r\n\r\nRepeating the above analysis we see a much less uniform distribution of dropoffs\r\n>\r\n![nightlife graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/nightlife.png)\r\n\r\nAgain visualizing this on a map\r\n>\r\n<img src = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrevorRempel/Data-Incubator/master/Figures/NightlifeMapSize2.png\" height = 600>\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to meet people on a Friday night head over to \"The Duplex\" or \"The 55 Bar\"!\r\n\r\n#Future Directions\r\nThe above analysis is just scratching the surface of what this taxi data could tell us. In the future it would be interesting to explore some of the following ideas:\r\n\r\n* Correlate taxi trips with other data sources\r\n    - Weather\r\n    - Crime Rates\r\n\r\n* More sophisticated analysis of pickup and dropoff locations\r\n    - Cluster locations and see which venues fall into the most popular areas\r\n    - Filter based on time of day and day of week\r\n    - Formulate a model where historical trends in pickups/dropoffs give information about which business do well in certain areas","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
